# University of Edinburgh: Informatics - Software Engineering Coursework (2019/2020)

## Overview
The coursework involved us developing software for a federalised bike rental system via different stages including creating use cases to capture the requirements, visualising the design of the system using UML, and finally implementing and testing an partial, abstract version of software for the bike system.
This repository is the coding implementation part for our coursework.
